title: Lab Tour with Device Query
author: GPU Teaching Kit

# Objective

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with using the submission system for this course as well as the hardware used.

# Instructions

The code provided queries the GPU hardware on the system.
Do not concentrate on the API calls, but on functions starting with `wb`.

The `wbLog` function logs results, specifically we log the following hardware features:

* GPU card's name

* GPU computation capabilities

* Maximum number of block dimensions

* Maximum number of grid dimensions

* Maximum size of GPU memory

* Amount of constant and share memory

* Warp size

The details and meaning of these quantities will be explained in the
first few lectures of the teaching kit.
